The Diet Planner App is designed to provide personalised meal recommendations based on usersâ€™ health data, dietary preferences, and calorie requirements. 
The app helps users make informed food choices by suggesting appropriate recipes while considering ingredients, allergies, and dietary restrictions.
 The core logic is written in C and compiled into a DLL (dietplanner.dll). The GUI is built using Python with Tkinter. The Python script uses ctypes to call the C functions.
